      <h1>Halloween Costume Ideas for Adults and Children</h1>
        <p>
          The tradition of children wearing Halloween costumes originated from when the Celts lit bonfires and dressed up during ceremonies celebrating Samhain. Decked out in animal heads and full animal skin costumes, they proceeded to read each other's fortunes and tell stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The costume tradition made it's way to America and took on another form. On Halloween, it was believed that the spirits and ghosts of the dead came back to roam the earth. People then wore masks and "dressed up" in an outfit to look like one of the spirits to avoid being recognized as one of the living.

          Finding that perfect Halloween costume can be a challenging task and is best planned well in advance. While there are easy costumes available in stores, it may be more practical and even realistic to try a homemade one. From adults to teens to kids, funny to scary, below are some cool Halloween costume ideas (some naughty, some nice, some unique) to get you started.
